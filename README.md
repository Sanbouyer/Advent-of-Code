# Advent-of-Code
Welcome to my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) repository. This contains my solutions to past Advent of Code problems.

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is a fun yearly advent calendar of programming puzzles. Each day contains two puzzle parts, and the puzzles get more challenging as you approach Christmas. Its great to practice your logic and programing skills in small challenges. The official about can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/about)

## Why am I doing this?
After seeing my cousin @nailec1911 do the 2024 AoC, I wanted to join in on the fun.
Given that the Advents have already passed, I am not competing in the leaderboards, and instead this is more of a personal challenge for me.
Given that these are my personal attempts, they will **NOT** be the optimal solution or particularly well polished, but I hope that the are none-the-less clear to read and follow.
I will be starting from the 2024 puzzles and working my way back.
Hopefully by the time AoC 2025 comes around, I will still be motivated to wake up at 5am.

## Repo structure
The repo will be organised by year, and each year's folder will contain folders for the 25 days that I have completed.
Within these folders, I will have the input as a `input.txt`, and the main code as `dayX.py`. I may also add a `README.md` if there is anything in particular I want to say about that days puzzle.
